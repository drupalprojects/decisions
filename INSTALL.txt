Installation procedures for Decisions.gnuvernment.org
=====================================================

Step 0 - Fetch the source code
------------------------------

Since you're reading this, you probably know how to find the source
code. I'll tell you anyways. The decisions module is developped in the
contrib Drupal CVS repository. You can read the general instructions
on how to access this repository at:

http://drupal.org/node/321

... but the general recipe is something like:

cd drupal/modules
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal-contrib login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal-contrib co -d decisions contributions/modules/decisions

That's all.

Step 1 - Load the database schema
---------------------------------

Simply load the .mysql file using phpMyAdmin or the commandline mysql
client, following instructions similar to the original Drupal
INSTALL.txt file. Something like this should do the trick:

mysql -u drupal -p drupal < decisions.mysql

Step 2 - Install dependencies
-----------------------------

You need to download, install and activate the following modules in
order to have decisions working:

 * votingapi

In addition, Drupal's version must be superior or equal to 4.7beta4
(last version tested) because of the new forms_api.

Step 3 - Activate the module
----------------------------

By then you generally want to activate the module in the configuration
to have it do something significative. Head for:

http://localhost/admin/modules

(if you have clean_urls active).
