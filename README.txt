Goals : 

To develop a voting module for integration with Drupal that features flexible 
voting mechanisms, delegatable votes, taxonomy/category influenced controls 
and weighted voting to begin with.

Basic requirements:

* The tool allow people to reproduce and surpass the kinds of decision-making 
  instances that exist in face-to-face meetings.
* Voting systems should be modular and flexible.
* The tool should also allow evaluation of the representativity/distribution 
  of votes (quorum reached,
* We will make one or more Drupal modules for this.

Desired characteristics:

* modular: user can pick between different voting mechanisms
o optional quorum validation on all
o time limit vs. first past the post vs. quorum
* delegatable:
* taxonomic (allow categorisation of the votes to ultimately enable fine tune 
  control over delegation, etc.) that voting dela: we should be able to easily 
  plug into the "taxonomy" system (many other modules do this)
* weightable (perhaps too ambitious at this point, allow weighting of votes to 
  reflect, for example, karma, or impact-of-decision-on-user)
* ranking mechanism : the automatic spinoff voting would need this.
